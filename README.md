# queue-simulator
Project for UCLA graduate course, Biostatistics 213 - Computational Methods in Biostatistics.

Simulated 3 queueing models: (1) 3 servers and 3 lines, (2) 3 servers in tandem, and (3) 3 servers and 1 line in order to answer which model produced the smallest average wait time. 

The following assumptions for all models were used:
(1) Service time from all servers are the same.
(2) Arrival times are generated from a homogeneous poisson process.
(3) Departure times are generated from the gamma distribution.
